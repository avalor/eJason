To run this example, use two different command shells, even 
from different hosts:

********* Set up:

This scenario presents a basic debugging scenario that tests the monitoring
mechanism of eJason.

Each .asl file describes the steps that the agents carry out (mainly showing
how the MAS dynamics trigger the different monitoring notifications to the
monitoring agent).

Update the action ".connect_to(Container)" in killer.asl to the 
name of the host where the container 'home2' runs 
(i.e. 'home2@my_host').

Copy the corresponding ".asl" files into the folder "agents".

*********HOST 1*****

./ejason -c home2


*********HOST 2*****

./ejason -c home


> ejason:crun(testMonitor).
