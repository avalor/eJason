To run this example, use two different command shells, even in
from different hosts:

********* Set up:

This scenario presents a basic scenario including agent creation, monitoring
and distributed communication.

The supermarket just provides beer to the fridge upon request.
The fridge gives beer to the robot and request more to the supermarket.
The owner drinks beer, sleeps when there is no beer and restarts the robot.
The robot serves beer from the fridge to the owner up to a maximum,
which is reset when the agent is created anew.

The scenario finishes when the owner has drunk beyond its physical limit.

Update the action ".connect_to(Container)" in fridge.asl to the 
name of the container where the agent supermarket runs 
(i.e. 'shopping_mall@my_host').

Copy the corresponding ".asl" files into the folder "agents".

*********HOST 1*****

./ejason -c shopping_mall

Then start agent supermarket with:

> ejason:crun(supermarket).


*********HOST 2*****

./ejason -c home

Then start agents fridge and owner  with:

> ejason:crun(fridge).
> ejason:crun(owner).
